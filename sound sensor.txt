sound sensor using arduino

Sound sensors can be used for a variety of things, one of them could be turning lights off and on by clapping. 
Today however we are going to use hook up the sound sensor to an array of LED lights which will beat with music, clapping or knocking.

For this project the above components are required.

- Arduino
- Sound sensor
- Relay 5v Dc
- LED bulb
- Battery 5v
- Power supply
 
Connections:-
// Arduino power-(5v) to Sound sensor.
// Arduino power-(5v) to Relay-(vcc).
//
